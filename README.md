# **InfoScope**
### *A Mini News Search Engine built on classic IR principles*  
*(HTML • CSS • JavaScript • TF-IDF • BM25)*  
> *This website uses fictional news articles generated by AI. These articles should not be used for research.*

</div>

## Overview
**InfoScope** is a lightweight search engine built for my **CIST433: Information Storage & Retrieval** final project.  
It demonstrates how search engines actually *think* — using techniques like tokenization, stopword removal, and term weighting — all applied to a curated dataset of 400 news article summaries.

> *The goal isn’t to compete with Google — it’s to show that I understand how Google works.*
